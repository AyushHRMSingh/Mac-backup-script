# Mac-backup-script

This ia a simple shell script for MacOS (might work on linux idk) that I made for backing up files to my external drive when executed.

When executed, based on the the edited config.sh file it will backup the file/s to the stated directory.
Simply edit config file with teh destination folder as well as the list of files you want to backup or copy to that folder.

note: the program was a bit iffy with folders that had a space in their names so it is suggested to have a single word folder.
